## Jaeger and Telemetry

- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to provide observability for cloud-native software. It traces the lifecycle of a request as it travels through a distributed system.
- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. Collect and visualize traces, monitor the health of your applications, and diagnose performance bottlenecks.

The MAJOR version is incremented when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version is incremented when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version is incremented when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

- RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is a message broker that allows you to send and receive messages between distributed systems. It is a great tool for building scalable and reliable systems. You can use it to decouple your services and make them more resilient to failures.

- Morgan 
Morgan is a popular HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It logs the details of incoming requests, such as the HTTP method, URL, status code, response time, and more. It is a great tool for debugging and monitoring your Node.js applications.
