# Docker best practices

## Use verified base images

When building Docker images, it is important to use base images that are verified and maintained by the community. This helps ensure that your images are secure and up-to-date. 

If using a verified image is not possible, use a container image Scanner to check for vulnerabilities in your images.

## Use non-root users

Running containers as the root user can pose a security risk. Whenever possible, run containers as non-root users to reduce the risk of privilege escalation attacks.

## Avoid using `latest` tag

The `latest` tag is not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, use a specific version tag.

## Use multi-stage builds

Multi-stage builds are a feature of Dockerfiles that allow you to create smaller and more efficient images by using multiple build stages. This can help reduce the size of your final image and improve build times.

## Use `.dockerignore` file

The `.dockerignore` file allows you to specify files and directories that should be excluded from the build context when building an image. This can help reduce the size of your final image by excluding unnecessary files.

## Use `COPY` instead of `ADD`

The `COPY` instruction is preferred over the `ADD` instruction in Dockerfiles because it is more transparent and less prone to unexpected behavior. Use `COPY` to copy files from the build context to the image.

## Use `HEALTHCHECK` instruction

The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction allows you to define a command that Docker will run to check the health of your container. This can help you monitor the health of your containers and take action if they are not healthy.

## Use `docker-compose` for multi-container applications

For applications that require multiple containers, consider using `docker-compose` to define and run your multi-container applications. `docker-compose` allows you to define your application's services in a `docker-compose.yml` file and run them with a single command.

## Use environment variables for configuration

Use environment variables to configure your containers instead of hardcoding configuration values in your Dockerfiles. This allows you to easily change configuration values without rebuilding your images.
